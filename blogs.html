        <h2>Headline of a blog post</h2>
        <time datetime="2015-05-15 19:00">Jul 15 2015</time>
        <p>Last weekend I posted something on my personal Twitter page that a lot of people disagreed with. I got hate
            tweets for two days about it, which was baffling to me, because when did having a differing opinion become
            so offensive to people? Are we all supposed to be cookie cutter versions of one another, never having or
            voicing a contrasting idea or thought or viewpoint or opinion? How boring would life be if that was the
            case?</p>

        <p>Well, there's really no update...but I can tell you what little has happened.
            So, the guy, we'll call him JW texted me Friday night...saying we know some friend in common. Now, I'm fine
            with an initial text, but much like this set-up that went nowhere, ONLY texting doesn't really do much for
            me. Especially when we haven't MET yet.
            We texted back and forth, which was fine. Figured out we're the same age, from neighboring home towns, and
            he has a degree in Finance. All good. I already knew he had a daughter, and he mentioned he was going to her
            show choir competition the next day.</p>

        <h2>Another potential blind date...</h2>
        <time datetime="2001-05-15 19:00">May 15 2001</time>
        <p>Well, here we are in February and I might have another set-up...2 for 2 months! My friend texted me a few
            weeks ago about a guy she ran into (friend of her friend's husband's). Anyway, she realized he was single
            and sent me a text asking if I was interested. Mind you...this was prior to checking with the friend to see
            if this guy was even open to being set up. </p>
